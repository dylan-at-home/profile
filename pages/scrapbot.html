				Personal Project: Industrial Design 80% | Computer Science 20%

			<p class="section__subtitle">
				This poject was a personal undertaking to build the absolute
				cheapest desktop 3D printer while still maintaining some features
				that would be considered preferable in machines of higher quality.
				Such features include a heated bed, direct drive extrusion and 
				Core XY kinematics
			</p>
			
			<p class="section__subtitle">
				Construction materials are mostly salvaged such as the spare polycarbonate 
				sheeting for the printer panels that was processed down on a CNC router
				and the various bracketry specifically designed small and modular that
				was printed out of leftover filament from an industrial 3D printer 
				that was too small in length to be used for anything else and would 
				have otherwise ended up as scrap.
			</p>
			<img src="../source/portfolio/scrapbot_images/scrapbot-main.JPG" class="portfolio__page--image">
			<p class="section__subtitle">
				Stepper motors and most mechanicals and bearings were salvaged. 
				The power supply is from a discarded PC Tower and the only specific purchases 
				for this project were that of the off the Shelf extruder assembly, some belts 
				bearings, and the screen and main board.			
			</p>
			<p class="section__subtitle">
				The entire CAD model was created from scratch in solidworks with components 
				modelled into the assembly as they were found or decided upon. Firmware was 
				customised from <a href="https://marlinfw.org/">Marlin</a> via Arduino IDE.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="section__subtitle">
				In order to interact with the below model, left-click and drag or drag with 
				finger to dolly, right-click and drag or two finger drag to pan and middle 
				mouse button roll or pinch to zoom. The model may take a minute or two to load.
